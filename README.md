# La_Crime_AI
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing the LA Crime Data. The main goal of this project is to explore and apply AI techniques to clean and analyze the data, leveraging tools like scikit-learn and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection and missing value handling.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Imported and cleaned the crime data, focusing on handling missing values and ensuring the integrity of the dataset.
Anomaly Detection: Used the Isolation Forest model to identify and flag anomalies in the data, allowing for the detection of unusual or outlier events.
AI Application: Applied basic AI algorithms for data analysis, including techniques for filling missing values and detecting anomalies.

Tools used: 
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn (for machine learning and anomaly detection)
Isolation Forest
